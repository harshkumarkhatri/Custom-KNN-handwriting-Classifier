# Custom KNN Hand-writing Classifier
This is a custom hand writing classifier which i have tried to implement.
<br>
There are two notebooks in this repo.
* One of them has the implementation using the pre-built KNN classifier present in sklearn.
* Other one is a custom made KNN classifier which is used to predict the output numbers.

Dataset used:- MNIST digit dataset
